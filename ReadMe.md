NN-VIPSS - Jianjun Xia (2025)

------------------------------------

This code implements the algorithm described in

  **Variational Surface Reconstruction Using Natural Neighbors**  
   Jianjun Xia, Tao Ju.  
   *ACM Transactions on Graphics (Proc. ACM Siggraph 2025)*  

The primary function of this program is to predict the normal as well as the underlying surface of a given set of unoriented points.

Currently, the code is tested on Ubuntu OS 24.04, it should work at other platforms with minor modification. If you are not familiar with compilation on windows, we provide a pre-compiled [binary files](https://gowustl-my.sharepoint.com/:u:/g/personal/jianjun_x_wustl_edu/Ea108LLPWkJJrr3xBJBVrckB4ipwM4qRdXkxsJRkugdTmQ?e=cJ3dQI) for you to try. 


BUILDING
======================================================================================================


The code needs the following dependencies, all installed automatically via CMake FetchContent:

1) [Armadillo](https://gitlab.com/conradsnicta/armadillo-code)  
2) NLOPT  
3) [OpenBLAS](https://github.com/OpenMathLib/OpenBLAS) (need to enable OpenMP support, better recompile it when using Ubuntu)  
4) Eigen  
5) [CLI11](https://github.com/CLIUtils/CLI11)  
6) [pico_tree v0.8.3](https://github.com/Jaybro/pico_tree/tree/v0.8.3)  
7) [C++ JSON (nlohmann/json)](https://github.com/nlohmann/json)

Then go to the vipss folder, and build the Cmake file:
```
$ cmake -B build-dir
$ cmake --build build-dir
```

In the `build-dir` directory, there should be an executable called "nnvipss" (or "nnvipss.exe" on Windows if it is successfully built).


RUNNING
======================================================================================================

To run the code from the command line, type:

```
$ ./nnvipss -i input_file_name [-l user_lambda] [-o output_file_path]
```

where:
1. -i: followed by the path of the input file. input_file_name is a path to the input file. currently, support file format includes ".xyz" and ".ply". The format of .xyz is:  

2. -o: optional argument. Followed by the path of the output path. output_file_path is a path to the folder for generating output files. Default the folder of the input file.

3. -l: optional argument. Followed by a float number indicating the lambda which balances the energy (see the paper for details). Default 0 (exact interpolation), you should set and tune this number according to your inputs.

4. -s: optional bool argument(false or true, true for default). If true, the program would output the surface ([input file name].ply). 

5. --alpha : optional argument. Followed by a float number indicating the soft constraints level of the gradient length. Larger value means stronger constraints, the default value is 50, you may finetune if needed.   

6. --large_input : optional bool argument(false or true, false for default). For test on dense sampling cases, setting the option true, can reduce the average nature neighbor size, which is useful when we are doing the test on the large benchmark described in the paper.    

7. --max_iter: Followed by the a integer number, the default value 10000. You can finetune the number if you want early stop or more iteration for smoother results.

8. -a : [apative grid surface](https://jurwen.github.io/Adaptive-grid-for-implicit-complexes/) threshold value for surface generation, default value is 0.003.  

9. -w : MST weight type, 0 for angle score, 1 for a conbined weight(sqrt(dist) * score), default is 0. You may try 1 if the init normals are not correctly flipped for some tricky cases, especially when the there are large missing part on dense sampling cases.  
 

Some examples have been placed at data folder for testing:
```
$ ./nnvipss -i ../../data/points/doghead.xyz -o {your_own_out_dir}/doghead.ply 
```

The program will generate the predicted normal in [input file name]_normal.ply.
If -s is included in the command line, the program will generate the surface as the zero-level set of the solved implicit function ([input file name]_surface.ply).

:bell: To generate all the example in the paper, please run the makefigure.sh script in the vipss folder:  
check makefigure.sh file, and replace the out_dir with your output directory.
